# Radical Cobblemon Trainers

Over **1500** unique and **challenging** trainers, from the Pokemon ROM hacks *Radical Red* (v3.02) and *Unbound* (v2.0.3.2) as well as the main series games *Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl*, that will spawn naturally in your world.

## Description

**Trainer spawning**: Encounter different trainers in different biomes.

> Textures were procedurally generated in advance so trainer appearances do not resemble any specific figures.

**Story Mode**: Defeat leaders, rivals and many more to become the ultimate champion.

**Player Progression**: Limits how far players can progress by preventing pokemon in their party, below a certain level (*level cap*), to gain any exp until they have defeated the next key trainer (e. g. leader).

**Trainer Card**: The Trainer Card will help you to keep track of your progress, find information about trainers and to locate the next key trainer to increase your level cap, when they spawn nearby.

**Endgame**: There are many challenging trainers for you to encounter, even after becoming a champion. Seek out stronger trainers for better loot, or complete multiple series (again) to permanently boost your luck!
